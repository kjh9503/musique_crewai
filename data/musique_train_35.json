It has been featured in many television commercials and motion pictures, such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Meet the Parents, Matchstick Men, Vegas Vacation, Fools Rush In as well as the French - American comedy Crime Spree. In 2015, it was used in a television commercial for Bank of America and in 2017 was used in a trailer for the video game Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.

Its blade is typically between 13 and 20 cm (5 and 8 in) long, and has a flat edge and a sheepsfoot blade that curves in an angle approaching 60 degrees at the point. The word may refer to the wide variety of ingredients that a Santoku knife can handle: meat, fish and vegetables, or to the tasks it can perform: slicing, chopping and dicing, either interpretation indicating a muti-use, general-purpose kitchen knife. The Santoku's blade and handle are designed to work in harmony by matching the blade's width/weight to the weight of blade tang and handle, as with the original Japanese Santoku.[1]",

The single peaked at # 32 in June 1980, becoming his final Top Forty charting hit. It was also an Adult Contemporary hit, reaching # 10 in the US and # 2 in Canada. The song made a minor showing in the UK (# 59), however, recharted several years later and reached # 4 in 1986. Sinatra made two more studio recordings of the song in 1981 (for his NBC TV special The Man and His Music) and 1993 (for Capitol Records). From the latter, an electronic duet with Tony Bennett was produced for Sinatra's Duets album.",
