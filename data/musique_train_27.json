It is one of the few \"Zelda\" games not to take place in the land of Hyrule, and does not feature Princess Zelda or the Triforce relic.

The libretto is by Rameau's frequent collaborator Louis de Cahusac. Cahusac styled the work a \"ballet all\u00e9gorique\" (\"allegorical ballet\"), but it is usually categorised as an \"acte de ballet\". Its slender plot tells of Jupiter's announcement to a group of Egyptian shepherds of the birth of the god Osiris, who symbolises the baby prince. The piece may have started life as part of a larger work, \"Les beaux jours de l'Amour\", an \"op\u00e9ra-ballet\" Rameau and Cahusac planned but never completed for reasons which are still uncertain.",

These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings.
