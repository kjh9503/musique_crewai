Humanity is waiting for it.\" Unmoved by a harsh condemnation by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely at this time of the visit, Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages. This resulted in a joint Malta declaration, the first joint agreement on the Creed since the Reformation. Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church, which he described as \"our beloved sister Church\". This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes.",

Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.",

The congregation has grown to become broadly international in character providing worship in the English language. Since its emergence the congregation's strong core lay ministry and leadership was supplemented periodically by visiting or designated Anglican priests from St Edmund's Anglican Church in Oslo, and beginning in the 1990s was served by Peter Hogarth who served as the Assistant Chaplain for Western Norway. Mpole Samuel Masemola was installed as the congregation's first resident priest January 2013, and left in July 2015. Normal worship services were first held at the Engensenteret Chapel, Baneveien 1, near N\u00f8stet, and now at the historic Mariakirken i Bergen or St Mary's Church, Bergen. Within the scope of the Porvoo Communion the congregation enjoys close cooperation with the Bergen Cathedral parish of the Church of Norway. As a congregation within the Anglican Chaplaincy in Norway the Bergen Anglican Church is a part of the Archdeaconry of Germany and Northern Europe in the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe, which is part of the province of Canterbury in the Church of England.

However, in 1534 King Henry VIII declared himself to be supreme head of the Church of England. This resulted in a schism with the Papacy. As a result of this schism, many non-Anglicans consider that the Church of England only existed from the 16th century Protestant Reformation.",
