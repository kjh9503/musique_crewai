Bedel was collated to the rectorship of St. Pancras, Soper Lane, on 4 October 1561, and preferred to the vicarship of Christ Church, London, on 28 January 1567. The latter living he resigned in 1576 (Newcourt, '\"Rep\".' i. 320, 519). While vicar of Christ Church he preached \"a sermon exhorting to pity of the poor, which treatise may well be called the mouth of the poor\". It was delivered on 15 November 1571 and published in 1573. Waterland praises it as \"learned and elaborate\". This is his only extant work, although Wood says that he was the author of other sermons.",

Luke -- Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or ``apology ''for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law. On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews, and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah.",

Justin Martyr (100\u2013165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \"That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\" Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having \"five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails.\"",
