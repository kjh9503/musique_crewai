In an article written in Life Magazine, John Foster Dulles then defined his policy of brinkmanship as`` The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art.'' During the Cold War, this was used as a policy by the United States to coerce the Soviet Union into backing down militarily. Eventually, the threats involved might become so huge as to be unmanageable at which point both sides are likely to back down. This was the case during the Cold War; the escalation of threats of nuclear war, if carried out, are likely to lead to mutually assured destruction.",
