The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from ``Australia's sons let us rejoice ''to`` Australians all let us rejoice''. The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at Federation in 1901.",
