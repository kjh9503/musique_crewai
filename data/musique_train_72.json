The bread is oval or rectangular and baked in a tandoor, a cylindrical oven that is the primary cooking equipment of the sub-continental region. The Afghan version of the tandoor sits above ground and is made of bricks, which are heated to cook the bread. The bread, also known as \"naan\", is shaped and then stuck to the interior wall of the oven to bake. It is really similar to the Naan in KPK, Pakistan. Black cumin or caraway seeds are often sprinkled on the bread, as much for decoration as for taste, and lengthwise lines are scored in the dough to add texture to the bread.",

It is a flat and round loaf, usually about in diameter and deep, with an indent in the middle produced by the baker. Elsewhere in the world, bread considered similar to the stottie is known as 'oven bottom bread', though this term is a relative newcomer, given that, prior to the widespread use of cast iron ovens with shelves, ovens were built of brick and only had the bottom available to bake on. One chief characteristic is the heavy and dough-like texture of the bread. Though leavened, its taste and mouth-feel is heavy and very reminiscent of dough. It is heavy and dense because it was only been allowed to prove once rather than the usual twice. This indicates that its origins lie in the breads used to 'test' ovens, and that it may be related to similar breads baked elsewhere in Europe for the same reason. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that some stotties were made with the offcuts of dough when all of the required loaves had been baked.",
