She tendered her resignation due to disagreements, with the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank Board members, who amended the lawyers of the legacy entity, without consulting her.

He falsified his age (and place of birth) to enlist in the local Territorial Force battalion, claiming that he was 19 years of age. In 1916, Digby-Worsley was evacuated from France to the Red Cross Hospital in Gloucester with a severe case of trench foot, after serving in Flanders for only two months. Digby-Worsley's mother then attempted to have him excused from further duty at the front on grounds of age. By this time, however, Digby-Worsley had already been appointed as a drill instructor, and the Middlesex Regiment clearly felt that his services were needed to train recruits at home, which he did until his transfer to the King's Own Scottish Borderers.",
